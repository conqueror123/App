Android is Linux based .True
Android has a shell .True
Android is exploitable.You said it kid

In this tutorial i'm gonna tell you guys .How to hide the data in android without using app lock or other apps.
Open your file manager
create a new folder
cut paste all the data (images,videos,text documents...etc)
Open settings of the file manager.
Press show hidden files.
Rename the folder as .something Remember to put a dot in front of filename.
now press hide files in the setting.

voila
Now try openin those images using gallery.It won't be visible.
Now try searching for those filed it won't be visible.

To see that data again you need to
open file manager
unhide
open the folder .something
there, you have your data back

Here's whats going on here.When we put a dot in front of any filename .It is not visible to the normal app(I.e, your gallery app).Which uses normal commands to search for data.

Same thing goes for linux.
