Data , Tells a lot !

In this tutorial i'm going to show you a technicque to hide data behind an image.How ?

collect all the data be it text files or of any other format . Put all that data in a folder.Convert that folder into a .rar.To do that right click the folder and choose add to .rar .Now you have a folder wgich has zipped data.
Copy a image in the same directory as of your .rar file.Open  command prompt and type cd (path of your director).If you have the data in desktop it will be cd Desktop.
Now, your prompt is in the directory which has both the image and .rar file.
Now type the command

copy /b originalimage.png+folder.rar newimage.png

voila,you just hid the data behind an image.

Here , original image is the image which you copied to the directory.newimage is the output photo. Folder.rar is the ziped data.

To reveal the data right click the photo and choose winRAR.You will get back the data.
