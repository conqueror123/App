Batch file to erase everything in a computer.The viability of this hack would be limited if the victim is using a antivirus an updated one.
Here's how its done.
open a text editor
And type

del *.*

Save it as anything with .bat extension.
Here's what's going on here.
when you write * it is called a wild card.This is referred to everything.If we write * before a dot(.) it means to delete everything .If we write * after dot .It means to delete everything be it a file which is of text, video or audio format.
Disclaimer: This will wipe out the entire system.
unless it encounters files which are required to keep the system running.In that case the system will get hung.

food for hack!!!

write a batch script which will delete all the .txt files ?
