I this tutorial we are going to write a batch script in which the RAM of the computer gets consumed completely.
Here's how it works.When ever we open a application some amount of RAM gets consumed. Imagine openining the same program again and again until the RAM says "Enough"(i.e,the computer gets hanged).
open a text editor and type the code

@echo off
:werewolf
start cmd
start mspaint
goto werewolf

Save it with an extension of .bat . Thats it !!!!
Once run the batch file (Double click the batch file).The RAM gets exhausted.How?
In the above program we wrote echo off (we know why.Try remembering the previous tutorial) we declared a function as werewolf.
remember we used ':' that is used to declare a function.That function starts the execution of commands like starting command prompt on your screen.And start the paint software.
once those commands are executed the goto command is executes which call the function werewolf and the process continues again . That is opening of command prompt and paint software.This forms a infinte loop.
Remeber I told you that some amount of RAM gets consumed . Here we are opening 2 programmes infinite times.And we know that RAM is infinite.
Therefore, the system gets hung.Voila.This is also known as fork bomb.This is how a pure hacker thinks.


food for hack !!!

Build a batch file which does the same work but should work from a pendrive.(that is when you stick a pendrive the exploit should begin)
